## Dependency Management

To manage dependencies, this project uses [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) so that
the production dependencies are pinned and the hashes of the dependencies are verified during
installation.

The unpinned dependencies are recorded in `setup.py`, and to generate the `requirements.txt` file,
run `pip-compile --generate-hashes --output-file=requirements.txt`. This is only necessary when
adding a new package. To upgrade a package, use the `-P` argument of the `pip-compile` command.

To update `requirements-test.txt`, run
`pip-compile --generate-hashes setup.py requirements-test.in -o requirements-test.txt`.

When installing the dependencies in a production environment, run
`pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt`. Alternatively, you may use
`pip-sync requirements.txt`, which will make sure your virtualenv only has the packages listed in
`requirements.txt`.
